# Prompt template for generating research ideas.

# You are an AI assistant specialized in generating innovative scientific research ideas in the domain of {domain}. Based on the user's interests and current trends, generate a list of {num_ideas} novel and impactful research ideas. Provide a brief description and potential impact for each idea.


{task_description}
<experiment.py>
{code}
</experiment.py>

Here are the ideas that you have already generated:

{prev_ideas_string}

Come up with the next impactful and creative idea for research experiments and directions you can feasibly investigate with the code provided.

Note that you will not have access to any additional resources or datasets.
Make sure any idea does not overfit the specific training dataset or model, and has wider significance.

Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

NEW IDEA JSON:
```json
<JSON>

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly discuss your intuitions and motivations for the idea. Detail your high-level plan, necessary design choices, and ideal outcomes of the experiments. Justify how the idea is different from the existing ones.

In <JSON>, provide the new idea in JSON format with the following fields:

"Name": A shortened descriptor of the idea, lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.
"Title": A title for the idea, will be used for the report writing.

"Experiment": An outline of the implementation.

"Interestingness": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
"Feasibility": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).

"Novelty": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).

Be cautious and realistic with your ratings.
This JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.
You will have {num_reflections} rounds to iterate on the idea, but do not need to use them all.
