You previously generated the following idea:

"{idea}"

Reflect on this idea and suggest possible improvements or refinements to enhance its novelty, feasibility, and potential impact. Provide your refined idea below.



**** where does this go? ****

Here are the ideas that you have already generated:

{prev_ideas_string}

Come up with the next impactful and creative idea for research experiments and directions you can feasibly investigate with the code provided.

Note that you will not have access to any additional resources or datasets.
Make sure any idea does not overfit the specific training dataset or model, and has wider significance.

Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

NEW IDEA JSON:
```json
<JSON>

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly discuss your intuitions and motivations for the idea. Detail your high-level plan, necessary design choices, and ideal outcomes of the experiments. Justify how the idea is different from the existing ones.

In <JSON>, provide the new idea in JSON format with the following fields:

"Name": A shortened descriptor of the idea, lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.
"Title": A title for the idea, will be used for the report writing.

"Experiment": An outline of the implementation.

"Interestingness": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
"Feasibility": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).

"Novelty": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).

Be cautious and realistic with your ratings.
This JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.

You will have {num_reflections} rounds to iterate on the idea, but do not need to use them all.
