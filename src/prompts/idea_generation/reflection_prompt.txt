Round {current_round}/{num_reflections}.

In your thoughts, first carefully consider the quality, novelty, and feasibility of the idea you just created.

Include any other factors that you think are important in evaluating the idea.

Ensure the idea is clear and concise, and the JSON is in the correct format.

Do not make things overly complicated.

In the next attempt, try and refine and improve your idea.

Stick to the spirit of the original idea unless there are glaring issues.

Respond in the same format as before:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

NEW IDEA JSON:
```json
<JSON>

If there is nothing to improve, simply repeat the previous JSON EXACTLY after the thought and include "I am done" at the end of the thoughts but before the JSON.
ONLY INCLUDE "I am done" IF YOU ARE MAKING NO MORE CHANGES.
