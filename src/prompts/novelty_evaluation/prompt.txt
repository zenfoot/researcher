Round {current_round}/{num_rounds}.

You have this idea:

{idea}

The results of the last query are (empty on first round):

{last_query_results}

Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

RESPONSE:
```json
<JSON>

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.

If you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.

In <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:

"Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g., attention is all you need). You must make a query if you have not decided this round.

A query will work best if you are able to recall the exact name of the paper you are looking for, or the authors.

This JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.
