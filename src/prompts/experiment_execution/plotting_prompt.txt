# Prompt for generating code to create plots and figures.

Great job! Please modify `plot.py` to generate the most relevant plots for the final writeup.

In particular, be sure to fill in the 'labels' dictionary with the correct names for each run that you want to plot.

Only the runs in the `labels` dictionary will be plotted, so make sure to include all relevant runs.

We will be running the command `python plot.py` to generate the plots.
