"""
Entry Point Module for Researcher System
========================================

This module serves as the main entry point for the Researcher application. It initializes and 
runs the orchestration agent that coordinates the system's workflows.

Module Structure:
----------------
- Imports the AdaptiveOrchestrationAgent from the agents package
- Defines a main() function as the entry point
- Includes standard Python idiom for script execution

Functions:
---------
main()
    Initializes and runs the orchestration workflow.
    
    Returns:
        None
    
    Side Effects:
        - Creates an instance of AdaptiveOrchestrationAgent
        - Executes the main workflow through the orchestrator, initiating various processes
        - May raise exceptions if the workflow encounters errors (consider implementing error handling)

Usage:
-----
The script can be run directly:
    $ python main.py

Or imported and used in other modules:
    from main import main
    main()

Expected Output:
---------------
Upon successful execution, the user can expect to see output indicating the progress of the 
workflow, including steps completed and any results generated.

Dependencies:
------------
- agents.adaptive_orchestration_agent.AdaptiveOrchestrationAgent
